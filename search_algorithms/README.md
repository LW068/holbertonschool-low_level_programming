# search_algorithms

# Description:

Search algorithms are methods used to find specific items or values within a particular data structure, such as an array or list. The efficiency and method of searching depend on the type of algorithm used. Common search algorithms include Linear Search, where each item is checked sequentially, and Binary Search, where the search range is repeatedly divided in half to quickly narrow down the location of the target. The choice of search algorithm can depend on factors like whether the data is sorted and the specific needs of the application, such as speed or memory efficiency. These algorithms form the basis of many operations in computer science and are foundational to the functionality of databases, search engines, and many other systems.
