# More Single Linked Lists

## Description

A Linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes, connected through links. Nodes in a linked list are connected by pointers. Linked are NULL terminating, which means whenever the pointer to the next node is NULL, the list has reached the end.

Generally, “linked list” means a Singly linked list. This list consists of several nodes in which each node has a next pointer to the following element. The link of the last node is NULL, which indicates the end of the list.
